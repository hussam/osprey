\section{Motivation}

Building a modern distributed service that guarantees service-level objectives
is hard. Complexity is introduced by the deployment environment and exacerbated
as the service evolves with time to accommodate hardware/environment changes or
support new features.
For example, to build a simple caching layer that guarantees a certain response
latency and throughput, developers need to take into account the number of
machines available to run that service, the network connecting these machines,
the storage hierarchy within each machine, the expected workload that the
caching layer will be servicing, and interference from other applications on the
network and machines.  A change in any one of these parameters could render the
service wildly inefficient.

Traditionally, this complexity is addressed by using highly-skilled developers
to build custom systems that are optimized for specific configurations and
objective functions.  Is there a general, principled approach to dealing with
complexity in distributed systems?
In this position paper, we propose a research project to study the use of Online
Machine Learning (ML) in distributed systems.  Hand-tuning the design and
configuration of distributed systems does not scale well with increased
complexity of software design, hardware architecture, deployment environment,
and strict service-level objectives.
To highlight this, here are some examples of where we think ML can help:

- contextual multi-armed bandits. idea is to provide a context, get an action,
and only observe reward for that action. This matches the dist systems world well. It will generate new
policies using ML that we could not come up with by just thinking, and may not
even be able to describe. We argue in favor of opacity and rely instead on the guarantees
provided by the ML optimization.

We describe some of hte unkowns we face and where ML can come in


\subsection*{Known unknowns}
Systems often make decisions without having complete knowledge of all the
factors that affect, or could be affected by, these decisions.  For example, a
caching system evicts items based on what it thinks future requests will look
like, even though it cannot actually know what the future will look like. Here,
decisions are made in anticipation of future events.  In other cases, this
incomplete knowledge is due to the absence of data-computation locality. For
example, a load balancer makes decisions based on what it thinks is the current
load on other machines rather than what it actually is.

In both of these situations, assumptions are made about the unknowns offline in
\emph{design-time}--resulting in different routing and caching
algorithms. A change to the \emph{run-time} environment could render these
decisions wildly inefficient. By deferring to an ML agent, these decisions can
be made online, and can be nimble in adapting to any changes to the run-time
environment.

\subsection*{Unknown unknowns}
In some situations, system designers have no way of knowing deployment details
that would impact the system's performance. For example, a system could be built
for external deployment and used by third party customers, or it could be
deployed in a multi-tenant environment where co-located services could impact
its performance.

In these cases, it is near impossible for developers to account for all the
unknown variables in design-time. However, an ML agent is able to make decisions
online based on inputs from the run-time environment.

To be clear, ML has been used in some distributed systems. However, it has not
been used in a general way to make online decisions about core distributed
systems implementation details. We advocate that developers should focus on
high-level objectives of their system, and use online ML to make to compute the
specifics (such as policies for request routing, replica placement, or failure
monitoring) at run-time based on observed metrics.


\section{Applying Online Learning to Distributed Systems}

- Framework is to threat ML as a black box. The Decision Service is an exmaple of such a system.
The blackbox takes as input a context, teslls us an action, and then expects us to give it
a reward. Thus it can be placed anywher a decision has to be made, such as which request
to route to, where to place replicas, etc.. Despite the simplicity provided by the ML interface
and we assume the rest of it is solved: it colelcts the data, optimizes a model, and delivers the model
to us quickly (let's even assume the latency of htis loop, which can be minutes, is good enough to adapt
to the rate of change in our environment). Now the remaining piece is to figure out what
to enter as context, how to execut the actions, and how to determine or report rewards.

We argue that there are big challenges even in doing just these things...

Using online ML in distributed systems poses many issues and open questions.
Here are some preliminary questions that we think are worth studying:
- Questions viewed from the lens of characteristics of distributed systems

[merge below above]

\subsection*{Framing}
An online ML loop, like Microsoft's Multi-World Testing Decision Service, views
the external world in terms of \emph{context} (a summarization of the world's
history), \emph{actions} suggested by the agent, and \emph{rewards} collected on
these actions. How can a distributed system's current state and service-level
objectives be translated into context and rewards? In some scenarios, such as
request routing for load balancing, the translation is easy. In others, like
replica placement, the translation is hard.

\subsection*{Hierarchy}
Distributed systems are often designed in a hierarchical manner, where
subcomponents are monitoring and managing others. These components and layers of
indirection simplify reasoning about the system at large. However, it is not
clear how hierarchy will affect an ML agent.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Will hierarchy aid the learning system via parallelism? Or will it hinder
    it since not all features are visible at every level?
  \item Should learning happen in each component of the system? Or should it be
    centralized?
  \item If learning is happening at multiple levels of the hierarchy, will that
    create interference between the learners? Or will they complement each
    other?
\end{itemize}

- Should feature vectors cut across the levels or not?
- In general should be composable if at each level can define decision and reward,
and exploration randomization is different at each level

\subsection*{Locality}
Decisions made by an ML agent in distributed system are likely to rely on input
data collected from diverse and physically distributed components. As a result,
the input to the learning loop might be stale or inconsistent. What could be
done to mitigate those issues while making reasonable real-time decisions?
Additionally, the decisions outputted by the learning agent need to be executed
by diverse and distributed components. How could routine distributed systems
issues such failures and delays in an asynchronous setting affect the learning
system?

\subsection*{Feature selection}
What features of the run-time system are important to the ML agent? How can they
be captured effectively? Can the ML agent learn from incomplete data? For
example, if an ML agent needs to make decisions regarding performance
optimization, would ignoring garbage collection activities or the VMM result in
corrupting the learned model? How sensitive should the learner be?

- quesiton of what features to include is there, but being conservative usually the right
way to go
- bigger quesiton is how ml component deals with omissions and other problems. Separate
into failure sections? Yeah, replace this with ``failures'' and move feature selection stuff
down to last section

\subsection*{Training}
An ML agent can be trained offline with pre-labeled data. However, is this
possible in the context of distributed systems? An online learning systems is
more logical in this context, however, how do we quantify the costs of
exploration vs exploitation of learned strategies?

- Probably omit this, or replace with ``Randomization''. Basically, we already know
that exploratoin-exploitation is the right approach, and that will be encapsulated
by the ML component (its decisions will reflect this, and it will take care of
computing probabilities etc.). But there's an interesting point about inherent randomization
in systems

\section{Expanding the scope}

Two drawbacks: opacity and scope.

Opacity (also, which features matter?)
- We are also pursuing work on cracking models open to see what they are doing inside.
There are different ways to gain insight as to what a model is doing. For example a simple
linear model may learn a vector of weights on the supplied features. These weights can be
studied, and indeed some techniques such as lasso are oftne used to reduce the number of features. However, these
techniques need to be handled carefully. Just becasue a feature has 0 weight doesn't mean it
can be removed: perhaps it is unimportant preceisely because it exists, and its removal all of
asudden changes the weight on other features.

Scope:
The above replaces the policy behind a decision with one backed by an ML learning system.
Indeed systems like hte DS were designed to intervene at the decision making point in a
slim way. The above outlines the issues which tackled would result in ML based policies,
new ones. However, once the above has been mastered, there is the question of whether ML
can influence distributed systems design at a higher level. For example, can it suggest
different mechanisms for achieving a goal, or perhaps a different design of the system in the first place?
